# Usage

I'll explain how I use it. 

Your cloudflare account has client certificate section, even on free tier. You can find it in SSL/TLS->Client Certificates->Create Certificate.

When you create certificate you are given CSR and private key. Paste them in bundler form and, optionally, you can set filename.

After that you will be given you bundled pfx file.
